					<h2>1.Not Official</h2>
					<p>These APIs do not comes from the Nuist Officials,they are created by me(Mr Wang). My webserver takes their running tasks, they grab the data from the official sites.</p>
					<h2>2.Safe Here</h2>
					<p>I will not store your any user data in my webserver, except the cookie files during grabing data. But the cookie only works and exist in a very short time(
						<1s), so it 's useless to me and I wil not check them. I ask every developers to encode your password before
						Http request because it's the official request, I will not decode the password, I 'm just a middle man and will not afford any risk.</p>
					<h2>3.Not So Stable</h2>
					<p>Theses APIs are used for free, so I have no obligation to ensure it's stability. But don 't worry, as long as my blog can be visited, these APIs can works. If the official sites changes a lot, APIs will also be affected for a long time.</p>
					<h2>4.Once You Use API, That Indicates You Have Agreed With The Disclaimer</h2>
					<a href="index.html" class="btn btn-danger btn-lg pull-right">  Agree  </a>
